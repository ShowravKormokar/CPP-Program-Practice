/*

a simple text-based Hangman game in C++ could look like:

*****Steps*****

1. Create a list of words that will be used in the game, such as "computer", "science", or "programming".

2. Pick a random word from the list and store it as the answer word.

3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of incorrect guesses allowed (e.g. 6 for traditional Hangman).

4. Display a placeholder for each letter in the answer word (e.g. "_ _ _ _ _ _").

5. Get a letter from the player as their guess.

6. Check if the guess is in the answer word. If it is, reveal the letter in the placeholder. If not, decrement the number of incorrect guesses allowed.

8. Repeat steps 5-6 until either the player has revealed all the letters in the answer word or they have used up all their incorrect guesses.

9. Display a message indicating if the player won or lost and ask if they want to play again.

Here's a basic code sample to get you started:

*/

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

int main()
{
    std::string words[] = {"computer", "science", "programming"};
    srand(time(0));
    std::string answer = words[rand() % 3];
    int incorrect = 6;
    std::string placeholder(answer.length(), '_');

    while (incorrect > 0)
    {
        std::cout << "Incorrect guesses left: " << incorrect << std::endl;
        std::cout << placeholder << std::endl;
        char guess;
        std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        std::cin >> guess;

        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < answer.length(); i++)
        {
            if (answer[i] == guess)
            {
                placeholder[i] = guess;
                found = true;
            }
        }
        if (!found)
        {
            incorrect--;
        }
        if (placeholder == answer)
        {
            std::cout << "You win!" << std::endl;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (incorrect == 0)
    {
        std::cout << "You lose! The answer was: " << answer << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

/*
<----- Summary of this program----->
This code is a simple text-based Hangman game in C++.

The game starts by defining an array of words, such as "computer", "science", and "programming", and selecting a random word from the array to be the answer. The code then sets the number of incorrect guesses allowed to 6 and initializes a string placeholder to keep track of the correct guesses.

In the while loop, the game displays the incorrect guesses left and the placeholder, prompts the player to enter a guess, and checks if the guess is in the answer word. If the guess is correct, the corresponding letter in the placeholder is revealed, otherwise the number of incorrect guesses is decremented. The loop continues until either the player has guessed all the letters correctly or has used up all their incorrect guesses.

Finally, the code displays a message indicating if the player won or lost and what the answer was.
