****Here are some popular C++ projects for computer science and engineering students:

1. Text-based Game Development: Create a simple text-based game such as Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, or Snake using C++.

2. File Management System: Implement a file management system that can perform basic file operations such as creating, reading, and deleting files.

3. Scientific Calculator: Create a scientific calculator that can perform advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometry, logarithms, and more.

4. Image Processing: Write a program to perform basic image processing tasks such as resizing, filtering, and edge detection.

5. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development: Build a simple GUI application such as a weather app, a music player, or a notepad.

6. Database Management System: Implement a database management system that can perform basic database operations such as inserting, updating, and retrieving data.

7. Networking Project: Write a program that implements basic network protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, or DNS.

8. Artificial Intelligence Project: Develop a simple AI-powered program such as a chatbot or a recommendation system.

9. 3D Graphics Engine: Create a simple 3D graphics engine that can render 3D models and scenes.

10. Parallel Computing: Implement a program that utilizes parallel computing techniques to perform computationally intensive tasks such as Monte Carlo simulations or matrix operations.

These projects will help students learn and apply key concepts in computer science and engineering, and provide hands-on experience with C++ programming.
